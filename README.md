In this project, I developed sentiment analysis on movie reviews, employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal was to create a website using Streamlit for interactive analysis.

To build a robust predictive model, I utilized a dataset comprising around 10,000 reviews sourced from the IMDb dataset. The preprocessing phase involved vectorizing the categorical data using the bag-of-words technique.

For predictive modeling, I applied various algorithms, including Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and ExtraTrees. This comprehensive approach aimed at achieving enhanced accuracy and precision in predicting sentiment outcomes.
